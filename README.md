# Usage
Just download the files and open [index.html](index.html) in your browser.

# Features
* Proper physics models dealing with gravity, acceleration, angular drag, thrust direction, colliders, etc. Everything implemented from scratch.
* The lander only has a limited amount of fuel
* Map generation. Every time you play you get a new scenario!
* A succesfull landing depends on the velocity of the lander
* Particle explosion when crashing
* Three difficulty modes: easy, medium, hard.

# To Do
* Improve the landing method to detect also the landing angle (currently only takes into account the magnitude of the velocity)
* Improve the collider. Currenlty using a circle for the Lander
* Improve the map generator
